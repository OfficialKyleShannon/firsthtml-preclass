This is where I begin my journey to becoming a Software Engineer!

Throughout my journey, I will be forging a project for each language I learn (don't judge too hard!).

Please don't hesistate to provide any feedback/advice along the way - I'm a good listener and will put your advice into action.

Without further due - let the journey begin! ðŸš€
